# BoYuanRoadLaneDetection

## Introduction
This repo is an implementation of Lane-Detection algorithm based on OpenCV. The dataset comes from Boyuan Road (a testing road of autonomous vehicles) in Shanghai China. Dataset is collected using monocular wide-angle camera. Recently some adaptive improvements and optimizations have been made, especially in the traditional image filtering process, and good results have been achieved.

## In addition
The lane offset can be calculated based on lane line ground truth data.
