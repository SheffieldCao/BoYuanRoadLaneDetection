# BoYuanRoadLaneDetection

## Introduction
This project replicates the lane detection method in _CARND_. The dataset comes from Boyuan Road (a testing road of autonomous vehicles) in Shanghai China. Dataset is collected using monocular wide-angle camera. Based on the original algorithm, some adaptive improvements and optimizations have been made, especially in the traditional image filtering process, and good results have been achieved.

## More
In ```v1.0``` branch, the calculation of the specific lane offset will be supplemented, and the offset is based on the Ground Truth Labeler.
