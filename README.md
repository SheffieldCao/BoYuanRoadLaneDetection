# BoYuanRoadLaneDetection

## Introduction
This project replicates the lane detection method in _CARND_. The dataset comes from Boyuan Road (a test road for autonomous driving) in Shanghai, China. Data is collected using monocular wide-angle camera. Based on the original algorithm, some adaptive improvements and optimizations have been made to the traditional image filtering process, and good results have been achieved.

## More
In ```v1.0```, the calculation of the specific lane offset will be supplemented, and the offset is based on the true label of the lane on the ground.
